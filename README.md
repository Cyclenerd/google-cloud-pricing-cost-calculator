Calculate estimated monthly costs of Google Cloud Platform products and resources.
Optimized for DevOps, architects and engineers to quickly see a cost breakdown and compare different options upfront:

* Mapping of resource usage is done in easy to learn **YAML** usage files
* Price information is read from a local file
* Calculation is done via `gcosts` **CLI** program
* Calculated costs are saved in **CSV** files

Full control and no disclosure of any information and costs to third parties.
Everything tested and matched against the actual invoice in large Google Cloud migration projects.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Supported resources

The cost of a resource is calculated by multiplying its price by its usage.

| üí° Google Cloud Free Program |
|------------------------------------------------|
| Free tiers and free trial (90-day, $300), which are usually not a significant part of cloud costs, are ignored. For example: 1x free non-preemptible `e2-micro` VM instance per month, free NAT for 32 VMs, 30 GB-months standard persistent disk, 1 GB network egress and everything [else](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier/#compute) are not taken into account. |

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Start the interactive tutorial

This guide is available as an interactive Cloud Shell tutorial.
To get started, please click the following button:

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://shell.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator&cloudshell_git_branch=master&cloudshell_tutorial=cloud-shell-tutorial.md)


## üèÉ Quick start

### 1. Get `gcosts` program

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

**Debian/Ubuntu or Google Cloud Shell (x86_64)**

[Download](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/releases/latest) the executable `gcosts` Linux CLI program:
```shell
curl -OL "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/releases/latest/download/gcosts" && \
chmod +x gcosts
```

Execute `gcosts`:
```shell
./gcosts --help
```

If you using another Linux or UNIX operating system, please see the [Development](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator#-development) section.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

**Microsoft Windows (x86_64)**

[Download](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/releases/latest) the executable `gcosts.exe` Windows CLI program:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/releases/latest/download/gcosts.exe" -OutFile "gcosts.exe"
```

Execute `gcosts.exe`:
```powershell
.\gcosts.exe --help
```
</details>

### 2. Download price information

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

[Download](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml) the latest and tested price information file `pricing.yml`:
```shell
curl -L "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml" \
     -o "pricing.yml"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

[Download](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml) the latest and tested price information file `pricing.yml`:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml" -OutFile "pricing.yml"
```
</details>

### 3. Run it

Create your first YAML usage file (`usage.yml`):
```yml
region: europe-west4
project: my-first-project
instances:
  - name: app-server
    type: e2-standard-8
    os: rhel
    commitment: 3
    disks:
      - name: disk-boot
        type: ssd
        data: 75
```

Execute the CLI program:

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

Execute `gcosts`:
```shell
./gcosts
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

Execute `gcosts.exe`:
```powershell
.\gcosts.exe
```
</details>

All YAML usage files (`*.yml`) of the current directory are imported and the costs of the resources are calculated:

Two CSV (semicolon) files with the costs are created:

1. `COSTS.csv`  : Costs for resources
1. `TOTALS.csv` : Total costs per name, resource, project, region and file

You can import the CSV files with MS Excel, [LibreOffice](usage/libreoffice.md) or [Google Sheets](usage/google_sheets.md).

### 4. Get familiar

Continue to familiarize yourself with the options. The following documentations are prepared for this purpose:

* [Create usage files](usage/)
* [Build pricing information file](build/)

**ü§ì Linux Tip**

Add `gcosts` to your Bash aliases with absolute pathnames. You can then execute `gcosts` anywhere.

Alias (`~/.bash_aliases`):
```shell
alias gcosts='/your-pathname/gcosts -pricing=/your-pathname/pricing.yml'
```


## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

If you want to modify the Perl scripts or prefer to run the uncompiled Perl scripts (`gcosts.pl`, `skus.pl`, `mapping.pl`, `pricing.pl`) and create the price information yourself,
the following requirements are needed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator)

Perl 5 is already installed on many Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat, SUSE) and UNIX (macOS, FreeBSD) operating systems.
For MS Windows you can download and install [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/).

### Requirements

* Perl 5 (`perl`)
* Perl modules:
	* [App::Options](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Options)
	* [LWP::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent)
	* [JSON::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS)
	* [YAML::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::XS) (and `libyaml`)
	* [DBD::CSV](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::CSV)
	* [DBD::SQLite](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite)

Debian/Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt install \
	libapp-options-perl \
	libwww-perl \
	libjson-xs-perl \
	libyaml-libyaml-perl \
	libdbd-csv-perl \
	libdbd-sqlite3-perl
```

Or install Perl modules with cpanminus:
```shell
cpan App::cpanminus && \
cpanm --installdeps .
```

Execute `gcosts.pl`:
```shell
perl gcosts.pl --help
```
