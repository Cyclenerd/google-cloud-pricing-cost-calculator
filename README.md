| üèÜ Awarded |
|------------------------------------------------|
| This project was [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/09/announcing-the-second-group-of-open-source-peer-bonus-winners-in-2022.html) winner in 2022 ü•≥ |

Calculate estimated monthly costs of Google Cloud Platform products and resources.
Optimized for DevOps, architects and engineers to quickly see a cost breakdown and compare different options upfront:

* Mapping of resource usage is done in easy to learn **YAML** usage files
* Price information is read from a local file (`pricing.yml`)
* Calculation is done via `gcosts` **CLI** program
* Calculated costs are saved in **CSV** file optimized for non-technical audience

Full control and no disclosure of any information and costs to third parties.
Everything is calculated on your local computer.
No need to have a connection to the Internet.
Everything tested and matched against the actual invoice in large Google Cloud migration projects.
Over 270 automated tests ensure `gcosts` reliability.
`gcosts` works on various OS and terminals, including Windows CMD, macOS iTerm2, and in CI systems like GitHub Actions.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Supported resources

The cost of a resource is calculated by multiplying its price by its usage.

| üí° Google Cloud Free Program |
|------------------------------------------------|
| Free tiers and free trial (90-day, $300), which are usually not a significant part of cloud costs, are ignored. For example: 1x free non-preemptible `e2-micro` VM instance per month, free NAT for 32 VMs, 30 GB-months standard persistent disk, 1 GB network egress and everything [else](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier/#compute) are not taken into account. |

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Start the interactive tutorial

This guide is available as an interactive Cloud Shell tutorial.
To get started, please click the following button:

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://shell.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator&cloudshell_git_branch=master&cloudshell_tutorial=cloud-shell-tutorial.md)


## üèÉ Quick start

```
</details>

### 2. Download price information

<details>
<summary><b>Linux</b></summary>

[Download](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml) the latest and tested price information file `pricing.yml`:
```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml" \
     -o "pricing.yml"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b></summary>

[Download](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml) the latest and tested price information file `pricing.yml`:
```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml" \
     -o "pricing.yml"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b></summary>

[Download](https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml) the latest and tested price information file `pricing.yml`:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-pricing-cost-calculator/raw/master/pricing.yml" -OutFile "pricing.yml"
```
</details>

### 3. Run it

Create your first YAML usage file (`usage.yml`):
```yml
region: europe-west4
project: my-first-project
instances:
  - name: app-server
    type: e2-standard-8
    os: rhel
    commitment: 3
    disks:
      - name: disk-boot
        type: ssd
        data: 75
```

Execute the CLI program:

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

Execute `gcosts`:
```bash
./gcosts calc
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

Execute `gcosts`:
```bash
./gcosts calc
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

Execute `gcosts.exe`:
```powershell
.\gcosts.exe calc
```
</details>

Without extra specification of the directory all YAML usage files (`*.yml`) of the current directory are imported and the costs of the resources are calculated.
You can specify the directory:
```bash
gcosts calc --dir DIRECTORY-PATH --pricing YML-PRICING-PATH
```

The calculated costs are exported to one CSV (comma-separated values) file.
Without specifying the file location, the file is named `costs.csv` and is saved in the current directory.
You can specify the CSV export file:
```bash
gcosts calc --csv CSV-EXPORT-FILE-PATH --pricing YML-PRICING-PATH
```

You can import the CSV file with MS Excel, Apple Numbers, LibreOffice or Google Sheets.

### 4. Get familiar

Continue to familiarize yourself with the options. The following documentations are prepared for this purpose:

* [Create usage files](usage/)
* [Build pricing information file](build/)

**ü§ì Tip**

Add `gcosts` to your Shell aliases with absolute pathnames.
You can then execute `gcosts` anywhere.

Alias (`~/.aliases`):
```bash
alias gcosts='/your-pathname/gcosts --pricing /your-pathname/pricing.yml'
```
