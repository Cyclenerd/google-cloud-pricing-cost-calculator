## GB vs GiB

Storage amounts are specified in GiB.

* GB  : base 1000
* GiB : base 1024

> 1 GB is often defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes.
> GiB (Gibibytes) is a standard unit used in the field of data processing and transmission and is defined as base 1024 rather than base 1000.
> For example, 1 GB is defined as 1000 3 bytes, whereas 1 GiB is defined as 1024 3 bytes.
