# Usage file

The configuration of the required resources is done in YAML files.

The `gcosts` program always imports all YAML usage files (`*.yml`) of the current directory.

The files are read in sorted order. You can therefore use the file names for an order.

Configurations are kept in memory and used for other files. Example:

1.yml:
```yml
region: europe-west4
project: test
```

2.yml:
```yml
buckets:
  - name: bucket
    class: standard
    data: 50
```

First `1.yml` and then `2.yml` is read.
The values `region` and `procect` from `1.yml` are also valid for `2.yml`.
So the cost for the bucket is calculated with region `europe-west4`.

## Configuration

### üìç Region

Set Google region:

```yml
region: GOOGLE-REGION
```

Supported regions can be found in [gcp.yml](../build/gcp.yml).

### üìÅ Project

Set project name:

```yml
project: PROJECT-NAME
```

### üàπ Discount

If Goolge gives you a discount on all resources (SKUs), you can set the discount:

```yml
discount: DISCOUNT-AS-FLOAT
```

The cost is multiplied by the value.

* 15% discount = 0.85
* 20% discount = 0.80
* 30% discount = 0.70
* 40% discount = 0.60

You can also use the discount for currency conversion.

Convert US Dollars to Euros:
```yml
# 1.00 US Dollar = 0.882 Euros
discount: 0.882
```

    * `hdd-replicated`      : Regional persistent disk (replicated)
* Balanced persistent disks
    * `balanced`            : Zonal persistent disk
    * `balanced-replicated` : Regional persistent disk (replicated)
* SSD persistent disks
    * `ssd`                 : Zonal persistent disk
