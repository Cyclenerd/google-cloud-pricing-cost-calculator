# Usage file

The configuration of the required resources is done in YAML files.

The `gcosts` program always imports all YAML usage files (`*.yml`) of the directory.

The files are read in sorted order. You can therefore use the file names for an order.

Configurations are kept in memory and used for other files. Example:

1.yml:
```yml
region: europe-west4
project: test
```

2.yml:
```yml
buckets:
  - name: bucket
    class: standard
    data: 50
```

First `1.yml` and then `2.yml` is read.
The values `region` and `procect` from `1.yml` are also valid for `2.yml`.
So the cost for the bucket is calculated with region `europe-west4`.

## Configuration

### üìç Region

Set Google region:

```yml
region: GOOGLE-REGION
```

Display all supported regions:
```bash
gcosts region
```
An overview of all supported [regions](https://gcloud-compute.com/regions.html) can also be found on the website: <https://gcloud-compute.com/regions.html>

### üìÅ Project

Set project name:

```yml
project: PROJECT-NAME
```

### üàπ Discount

If Goolge gives you a discount on all resources (SKUs), you can set the discount:

```yml
discount: DISCOUNT-AS-FLOAT
```

The cost is multiplied by the value.

* 15% discount = 0.85
* 20% discount = 0.80
* 30% discount = 0.70
* 40% discount = 0.60

You can also use the discount for currency conversion.

Convert US Dollars to Euros:
```yml
# 1.00 US Dollar = 0.882 Euros
discount: 0.882
```
